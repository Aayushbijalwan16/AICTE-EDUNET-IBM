# 🧠 AI Agent for Smart Farming Advice 


An AI-powered Smart Farming assistant built using **IBM Granite via watsonx.ai**, designed exclusively for  delivering real-time  weather forecasts, soil conditions, crop recommendations, pest control 
measures. This agent is focused, fact-based, and ethically aligned to assist farmers.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Farmers in the rural areas are struggled to stay updated with the current market prices of crops and they do not know the correct pest control measures according to their soil type and weather condition. Manually reviewing, filtering, and synthesizing information across multiple domains is time-consuming and inefficient. I built this agent to act as a **focused, domain-locked AI research assistant** that delivers **factual**, **unbiased**, and **well-structured information**.
